# World_Weather_Analysis

## Overview

This project is designed to help customers find their preferred locations and help them to plan their trips. Customers first enter their preferred min and max temperature, and then the program shows them cities that met their criteria. After that, customers choose four towns, and finally, the program creates their trip route and suggests a hotel in each city to rest.

## Tools

2000 random latitudes and longitudes, retrieve the nearest city, and perform an API call with the OpenWeatherMap. In addition to the city weather data you gathered in this module, use your API skills to retrieve the current weather description for each city.

Two thousand random latitudes and longitudes are generated, retrieve the nearest city by the Citypy library, and perform an API call with the [OpenWeatherMap](https://openweathermap.org/api). API is used to retrieve the current weather description for each town

Finally, to plot the map and visualize the cities' temperature, routes, and details, I used [google maps API](https://developers.google.com/maps).
